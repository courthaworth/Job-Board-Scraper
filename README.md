# Job Board Scraper

This project will be a web scraper that searches a number of job boards including YCombinator's Hacker News in order to find new job postings relevant to data science. The scraper will look for post titles that contain key words like Data, Machine Learning or ML. Once these postings are collected, the script will send an email to your email address containing hyperlinks to those postings.
